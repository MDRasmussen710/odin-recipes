                </p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1/4 cup fresh thyme leaves</li>
                    <li>4 cloves of garlic</li>
                    <li>1/8 cup dried oregano leaves</li>
                    <li>2 28 ounce cans of peeled San Marzano tomatoes (with basil preffered)</li>
                    <li>Salt</li>
                    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                    
                </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Slice the four cloves or garlic thinly. In a large pot start heating the olive oil on medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Once the oil is hot throw in the garlic and stir around until it starts to become golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Once the garlic has obtained the desired color throw in your fresh and dried herbs. Stir this mixture until aromatic.</li>
                    <li>After you can smell the herbs and garlic put in your San Marzano tomatoes, use a rubber spatula to scrape all of the juices of the inside of the can.</li>
                    <li>Stir the mixture and bring to a boil. Once you reach a boil take the mixture down to a simmer and let simmer for 45 minutes.</li>
                    <li>After 45 minutes remove from heat and blend adding salt to taste, use a blender or vitamix if you can, if not any hand blender will be sufficient although the sauce will be more chunky.</li>
                </ol>
